            <h3>Processions</h3>
            
            A live church is determined by the processions carried on. We as members ensures that the group carrying on the 
            procession is well supported in terms of singing as they dance for christ. It is not a competition but each group
             and jumuiyas as their specific day of procession.
             The group that is responsible for the procession is the one that prepares what to predecess the offertory.
