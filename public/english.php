    <h3>Sign of the Cross</h3>
    In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen
    <h3>The Apostles' Creed</h3>
    I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.
I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the power of the Holy
Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and
was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven,
and is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness
of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen
<h3>Our Father</h3>
Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
Amen.
<h3>Hail Mary</h3>
Hail Mary, full of grace! The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is
the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour
of our death. Amen.
<h3>Doxology</h3>
Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. As it was in the beginning, is now
and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.
<h3>An Act of Faith</h3>
O my God, I firmly believe that You are one God in three divine persons, Father, Son and Holy
Spirit. I believe that Your divine Son became man and died for our sins, and that he will come to
judge the living and the dead. I believe these and all the truths which the holy Catholic Church
teaches because You have revealed them, who can neither deceive nor be deceived. Amen.
<h3>An Act of Hope</h3>
O my God, trusting in Your promises and because You are faithful, powerful and merciful, I
hope, through the merits of Jesus Christ, for the pardon of my sins, final perseverance and the
blessed glory of heaven.
<h3>An Act of Love</h3>
O my God, because You are infinite goodness and worthy of infinite love, I love You with my
whole heart above all things, and for love of You I love my neighbor as myself. I forgive all who
have offended me and ask pardon of all whom I have offended. 
<h3>An Act of Contrition</h3>
O my God, I am heartily sorry for having offended Thee and I detest all my sins, because I dread
the loss of heaven and the pains of hell; but most of all because they offend Thee, my God, Who
are all good and deserving of all my love. I firmly resolve, with the help of Thy grace, to confess
my sins, to do penance, and to amend my life. Amen.
<h3>Morning Offering</h3>
O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary, I offer You my prayers, works, joys and
sufferings of this day in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world. I offer
them for all the intentions of the Sacred Heart: the salvation of souls, reparation for sin, the
reunion of all Christians, and the intentions of our Holy Father, the Pope. Amen.
<h3>The Divine Praises</h3>
Blessed be God. <br>
Blessed be His holy name.<br>
Blessed be Jesus Christ, true God and true man.<br>
Blessed be the name of Jesus.<br>
Blessed be His most Sacred Heart.<br>
Blessed be His most precious Blood.<br>
Blessed be Jesus in the Most Holy Sacrament of the Altar.<br>
Blessed be the Holy Spirit, the Paraclete.<br>
Blessed be the great Mother of God, Mary most holy.<br>
Blessed be her holy and Immaculate Conception.<br>
Blessed be her glorious Assumption.<br>
Blessed be the name of Mary, Virgin and Mother.<br>
Blessed be Saint Joseph, her most chaste spouse.<br>
Blessed be God in His angels and in His Saints.<br>
<h3>Grace Before Michael</h3>
Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts which we are about to receive from Thy bounty. Through
Christ our Lord. Amen
<h3>Thanksgiving After Meals</h3>
We give Thee thanks, almighty God, for all Thy gifts, who lives and reigns forever and ever.
Amen.
May the souls of the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Amen
